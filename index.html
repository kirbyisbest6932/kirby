    <hr > <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" >I had visited in dec 2018</h5> <p class="text-muted text-left" >Paris is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated population of 2,175,601 residents as of 2018, in an area of more than 105 square kilometres (41 square miles). Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, science and arts. The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an estimated population of 12,174,880, or about 18 percent of the population of France as of 2017. The Paris Region had a GDP of €709 billion ($808 billion) in 2017. According to the Economist Intelligence Unit Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore, and ahead of Zürich, Hong Kong, Oslo and Geneva. Another source ranked Paris as most expensive, on a par with Singapore and Hong Kong, in 2018. </p> </div> </center> <br><br>

    </h5> <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because it does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p> </div> </div>

His family shared the news Wednesday after his passing on Collins' Facebook page.
"We regret to share that our beloved father and grandfather passed away today, after a valiant battle with cancer," the statement read.
"He spent his final days peacefully, with his family by his side. Mike always faced the challenges of life with grace and humility, and faced this, his final challenge, in the same way. We will miss him terribly. Yet we also know how lucky Mike felt to have lived the life he did. We will honor his wish for us to celebrate, not mourn, that life. Please join us in fondly and joyfully remembering his sharp wit, his quiet sense of purpose, and his wise perspective, gained both from looking back at Earth from the vantage of space and gazing across calm waters from the deck of his fishing boat. Our family asks for privacy during this difficult time. Details on services will be forthcoming."

  April's full moon, called the "Super Pink Moon," wowed skywatchers on Monday (April 26) as it shone brightly in the night sky.

The Super Pink Moon rose Monday night and reached full phase at 11:32 p.m. EDT (0332 GMT on Tuesday, April 27), lighting up the sky with its big, bright glow until dawn on Tuesday. Skywatchers around the world, from Italy to England and the United States, captured stunning views of the pink supermoon, which is the first of only two "supermoons" in 2021 — depending on who you ask.  

A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides approximately with the moon's perigee, or the point in its elliptical orbit at which it is closest to Earth. This makes the moon appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than when it is farthest from Earth. But exactly how close perigee has to be to the exact timing of the moon's full phase is up for debate; "supermoon" is not a technical term used by astronomers. While some say that the March full moon was the first supermoon of 2021, others say the slightly closer full moon of April is the first.
